Who is this tiny dino?

Mad, green, but he ain’t mean
Cool shades on a fightin’ machine
Whippin’ tail and spittin’ fire
He’s a wizard of a lizard
Killer gecko for hire

(He’s uh) GEX
(T-Rex?) Uh-uh he’s GEX (What??)
GEX
He’s a wise-crackin’ cousin of the ??? gang

Walks cool while he talks trash
A mouth full of flies
Beats a pile of cash
He can hang and he can fly
He’s got to kill another TV to survive

(He’s uh) GEX
(T-Rex?) Uh-uh he’s GEX (What??)
GEX
Cold-blooded brother of the ??? boys

Suction cup paws get him up and around
Underwater, on a wall, or upside down
He’ll lose his tail, he’ll grow another
How could he use that mouth to kiss his mother?

GEX
(T-Rex?) Uh-uh he’s GEX (Say what??)
GEX (I say GEX)
He’s a wise-crackin’ cousin of the ??? gang

GEX (T-Rex?) Uh-uh he’s GEX (Say what??)
GEX
Cold-blooded brother of the ??? boys
GEX (I dunno man)

(A T-Rex?) Uh-uh he’s GEX (Say what??)
GEX
He’s a wise-crackin’ cousin of the ??? gang

GEX (Looks like a GEX to me) He’s GEX
(Get next to GEX) G-E-X, GEX
GEX (Looks like a GEX to me)

Cold-blooded brother of the ??? boys
GEX (I say GEX)
He’s GEX

(Guh-guh-guh GEX)
